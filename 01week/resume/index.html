   <td> <h3> Sail and Ski, Keyholder (2017-2018)</h3>
     <p> My most recent job was working at local boating goods and surf shop, Sail and Ski <br>.
       Working here allowed me to network with succesfull cliental, many of which owned <br>
       local companies and succesful growing or established businesses. <br> My main duties were
       opening and closing the shop, assembling wakeboards, delievering excellent customer <br>
       service, and maintaing a balanced inventory. </p>

   <td> <h3> Austin Coding Academy</h3>
     <p> As of april 9th, I have been attending Austin <br>Coding Academy for fullstack <br>
       web development. I intend on enrolling in <br> their UXUI design program after <br>
       completing the introductory development course. </p>
       <h3> Treehouse Web development </h3>
       <p> Early last year, I began taking online courses in <br> basic web development with
         <br> Treehouse. Treehouse is an excellent resource for a beginner <br>developer and
         has succesfully lead introductory <br>developers to find tech and development careers <br>
         through their Treehouse Degree track </p>
         <h3> Austin Community College </h3>
         <p> Directly after highschool, I enrolled in courses at ACC. <br> I found ACC to be
           an excellent place <br>to explore possible degrees <br> but was not interested in any of their
           <br> technological courses. </p>
   <td><p> While I am still new to  web development <br> I'm heavily engaged with projects and <br>
     courses involving major development skills. <br> Recently, I have created self-lead projects using <br>
     the following: </p> <ul>
   <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
<li> javascript </li>
<li>photoshop</li></td>

  <h3> IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE </h3>
  <p> Creating things is in my nature. I've never been able to sit still  and the moment an
    idea pops into my mind, I constantly try and figure out ways to manifest it. Never before
    have I worked in a creative field, although I've found that in all my prior work experience,
    I would always take up specific creative roles.  It's time for a change; I want to work
    in an enviornment that encourages creativity, and allows me to  organically produce
    and design new things. I see web development and UXUI as the perfect career field
    for myself. </p>
